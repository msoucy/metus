Metus is a set of high-level bindings for several C libraries in D.
Each one is designed to take advantage of Dâ€™s features, converting basic library constructs into Ranges that can be used with the Phobos standard library and utilizing some metaprogramming constructs to provide a clean, yet usable and functional, API.

The Metus repository provides a simple way to pull and update all of the components of Metus at once.
